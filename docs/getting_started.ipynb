    "Solvation analysis makes it easy to rapidly understand the coordination, pairing, speciation, networking, and residence of solutes in a solution. Solvation analysis is built on top of [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) so some familiarity with that package is needed for best use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you start with the tutorials, which walk through the basic usage of solvation-analysis and most of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorials:\n",
    "- The Basics: create and analyze a `Solute`\n",
    "- Multi Atom Solutes: generalize to solutes with many atoms\n",
    "- Visualization: use `nglview` to visualize structures\n",
    "- Residence and Networking: calculate residence times and solute-solvent networks\n",
    "- RDF Fitting: See how solvation-analysis finds solvation cutoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full catalog of the properties calculated, read through the API documentation. Solvation-analysis is a powerful tool that calculates a wide range of properties, it will take some time to master. If you ever have any questions, or encounter any bugs, please raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/solvation-analysis).\n"
